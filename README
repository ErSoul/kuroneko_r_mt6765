# Description

Customized Linux Kernel for Redmi 9C to run containers.

# Usage

You should run the `built-from-container.sh`, and it will build setup the right toolchain to compile the kernel.

Optionally you can apply the `show_kernel_flags.patch` to be sure that the configs are detected correctly on runtime. NOTE: this will pop-up a warning on boot, about something wrong with your phone.
